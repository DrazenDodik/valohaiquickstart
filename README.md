## Before you start

* Make sure you have Python 3 and pip installed on your machine
* You should have an active account on [Valohai](http://app.valohai.com)

## Setup your environment
* Create an empty folder where weâ€™ll store all the tutorial files.
* Create `train.py` inside the folder. Weâ€™ll write model training code in this file.
* Add `print("Hello Valohai!")` to `train.py` so we have a simple execution to test with.
* Create a virtual environment for Python 3, where weâ€™ll install all the libraries needed
    * `python3 -m virtualenv .venv`
    * `source .venv/bin/activate`
